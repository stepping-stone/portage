*firejail-lts-0.9.38.6 (18 Dec 2016)

  +files/firejail-lts-0.9.38.6-sysmacros.patch, +firejail-lts-0.9.38.6.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Move LTS version to separate package

  Having it in a separate package makes it easier for users to follow LTS
  branch of firejail. Before that users had to mask older versions to test
  LTS. It's better than having it slotted because portage by default picks
  up latest version from any slot and user would have to explicitly
  install particular slot.

  Package-Manager: Portage-2.3.3, Repoman-2.3.1
