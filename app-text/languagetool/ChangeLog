*languagetool-3.5-r1 (27 Nov 2016)

  27 Nov 2016; James Le Cuirot <chewi@gentoo.org> +languagetool-3.5-r1.ebuild:
  Bump guava SLOT, use Gentoo Java scripts

  guava:20 is needed so that Java 7 can be dropped from Gentoo.

  Using our Java scripts makes the ebuild cleaner, avoids symlinks, and
  ensures that the correct JVM is chosen at runtime.

  There are still many external libraries being bundled and we don't
  have the time to package them all right now but I have bumped jackson
  and friends to a newer version than is bundled here so that can be
  used and I've also introduced commons-collections:4.

  I noticed that jna:0 was used before, which is version 3, but it's
  actually version 4 that's bundled so I've amended that dependency.

  This was given the +1 by Radhermit.
