*Dist-Zilla-6.8.0 (21 Nov 2016)

  21 Nov 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org> +Dist-Zilla-6.8.0.ebuild,
  +metadata.xml:
  Add w/ version 6.8.0

  required by app-admin/rex for doing VCS installs.

  NOTE: This perl module is an "authorside" module and as such it is
  not TYPICALLY used by anything for installation, as the point of
  Dist::Zilla is to create simplifed distributions that don't need
  a lot of install-time magic.

  It is subsequently *not* used on typical CPAN sources, and should
  only be used against VCS sources to create an analog of a published
  CPAN distrubition as part of the VCS build workflow.

  Previously maintained in ::perl-experimental by Torsten Veller,
  Michele Beltrame and myself since May 2009

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.2
