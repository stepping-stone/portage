*Archive-Tar-Wrapper-0.230.0 (21 Nov 2016)

  21 Nov 2016; Kent Fredric <kentnl@gentoo.org>
  +Archive-Tar-Wrapper-0.230.0.ebuild, +metadata.xml:
  Add w/ version 0.230.0

  This is a recommended requirement for Dist-Zilla as it is substantially
  faster than using a Perl implementation of Tar for the same purpose.

  Explicit dependency on app-arch/tar due to this modules purpose being
  oriented
  around tar, or gnu tar, and may not work with other implementations.

  Package-Manager: portage-2.3.2
